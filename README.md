DSS 630 FINAL PROJECT
This work is related to a final project for my Masters of Business Intelligence and Analytics coursework. I was asked to create the database framework for an imaginary website called "Snubhub" where people can buy and sell event tickets on the resale market. I was tasked with identfying functional dependencies, normalizing the data, creating an ER Diagram, and finally writing the SQL code to build the database. 

NBA- PAST AND PRESENT:

2012 MEXICAN RESTAURANT SURVEY: 
This project is related to a 2012 Survey conducted in Mexico of consumer preferences on restaurants. The purpose of this project was to answer several different questions looking for potential biases in the results, understanding consumer preference, and making recommendations for potential investors.

HEALTHCARE- PATIENT PRIMARY CARE AND INSURANCE PROVIDER INFORMATION
This project explores healthcare data through SQL, focusing on primary care services and insurance provider payouts. Using a relational database with four key tables (Patients, Doctors, Appointments, and Insurance Providers), the goal is to analyze patient interactions, provider revenues, and healthcare trends.

The project answers four key questions using SQL queries:
1️ Which insurance providers have the highest total insurance payouts for primary care visits?
2️ Which doctors generate the highest revenue from patient visits?
3️ What percentage of appointments required a follow-up, and which doctors have the highest follow-up rate?
4️ How does smoking status correlate with appointment frequency?

Each query demonstrates SQL concepts such as JOINs, aggregation, CASE statements, and ordering results to uncover meaningful insights in healthcare operations.
